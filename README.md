Design a 19-element uniform linear scanning array with a spacing of Î»/4 between the elements
- What is the progressive phase excitation between the elements so that the maximum of the array factor is 30o from the line where the elements are placed?
- What is the half-power beamwidth of the array factor in part a? Verify using the computer program
- What is the value of the maximum of the first minor lobe?
